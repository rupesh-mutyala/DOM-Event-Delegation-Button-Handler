**Event Delegation for Button Clicks**

When working with multiple buttons within a parent element, consider using event delegation by attaching a single onClick handler to the parent element. Event delegation offers several advantages:

Memory Efficiency: By attaching one event listener to the parent instead of multiple listeners on each button, memory usage is optimized.

Performance: Event delegation can lead to better performance, especially when dealing with dynamically generated buttons or complex web pages.

Dynamic Elements: Newly added buttons (created dynamically) automatically inherit the event handling logic of the parent's listener.

Code Simplicity: Event delegation reduces code complexity and maintenance effort by centralizing event handling.
